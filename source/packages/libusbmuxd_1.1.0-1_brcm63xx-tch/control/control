Description: This daemon is in charge of multiplexing connections over USB to an iPhone or iPod touch. To users, it means you can sync your music, contacts, photos, etc. over USB. To developers, it means you can connect to any listening localhost socket on the device. usbmuxd is not used for tethering data transfer, which uses a dedicated USB interface as a virtual network device. This package contains the libusbmuxd shared library.
