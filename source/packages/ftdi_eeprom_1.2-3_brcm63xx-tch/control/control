Description:  ftdi_eeprom is a small tool for reading/erasing/flashing FTDI USB chip
 eeproms. It uses libftdi to access the chip, so you will need to have
 the required permissions on the device.
 
 The ftdi_sio module should not be loaded.
 
 You have to unplug and replug your device to get the new values to be
 read. Otherwise, you will still get the old values.
