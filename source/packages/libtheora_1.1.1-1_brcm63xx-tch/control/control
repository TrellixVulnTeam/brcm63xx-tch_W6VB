Description:  Theora is Xiph.Org's first publicly released video codec, intended
 for use within the Foundation's Ogg multimedia streaming system.
 Theora is derived directly from On2's VP3 codec; Currently the
 encoders are nearly identical, but Theora will make use of new
 features supported by the decoder to improve over what is
 is possible with VP3.
