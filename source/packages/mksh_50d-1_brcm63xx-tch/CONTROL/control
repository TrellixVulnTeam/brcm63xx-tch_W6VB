Description: mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si- milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh derivate currently being actively developed. It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use. mksh has UTF-8 support (in substring operations and the Emacs editing mode) and - while R50 corresponds to OpenBSD 5.5-cur- rent ksh (without GNU bash-like PS1 and fancy character clas- ses) - adheres to SUSv4 and is much more robust. The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli- ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi- lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own) are available. It has sensible defaults as usual with BSD.
