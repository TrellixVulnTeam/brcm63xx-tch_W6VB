Description: JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM specification version (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's (free and commercial) it is extremely small.However, unlike other small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and includes support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.
