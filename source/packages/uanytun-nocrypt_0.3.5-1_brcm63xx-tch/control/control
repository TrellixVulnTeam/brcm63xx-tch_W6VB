Description: uAnytun is a tiny implementation of SATP the secure anycast tunneling protocol. SATP defines a protocol used for communication between any combination of unicast and anycast tunnel endpoints. It has less protocol overhead than IPSec in Tunnel mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g. ethernet, ip, arp ...). SATP directly includes cryptography and message authentication based on the methods used by SRTP. It is intended to deliver a generic, scaleable and secure solution for tunneling and relaying of packets of any protocol. Unlike Anytun which is a full featured implementation uAnytun has no support for multiple connections or synchronisation. It is a small single threaded implementation intended to act as a client on small platforms.
