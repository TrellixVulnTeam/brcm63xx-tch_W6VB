Description:  Stunnel is a program that allows you to encrypt arbitrary TCP
 connections inside SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) available on both Unix
 and Windows. Stunnel can allow you to secure non-SSL aware daemons and
 protocols (like POP, IMAP, LDAP, etc) by having Stunnel provide the
 encryption, requiring no changes to the daemon's code.
