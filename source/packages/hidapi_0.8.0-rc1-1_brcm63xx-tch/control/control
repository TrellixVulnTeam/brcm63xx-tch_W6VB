Description:  HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
 with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac
 OS X.  HIDAPI can be either built as a shared library (.so or .dll) or
 can be embedded directly into a target application by adding a single source
 file (per platform) and a single header.
