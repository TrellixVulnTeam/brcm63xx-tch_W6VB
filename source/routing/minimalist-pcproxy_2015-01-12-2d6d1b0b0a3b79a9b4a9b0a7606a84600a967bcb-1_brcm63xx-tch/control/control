Description:  This package contains a daemon which can be used to forward
 PCP (Port Control Protocol - RFC6887) requests requests to PCP remote servers.
 
 In and of itself, it is not very useful, but combined with hnetd+miniupnpd
 it allows for control of NAT forwarding and firewall pinholes from multiple
 hops away.
