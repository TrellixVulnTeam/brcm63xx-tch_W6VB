Source: feeds/routing/alfred
Description: alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information over the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything which appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ... alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert information by using the alfred binary on the command line, or use special programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the information available from all alfred servers in the network.

Source: feeds/routing/babeld
Description: Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol roughly based on DSDV and AODV, but with provisions for link cost estimation and redistribution of routes from other routing protocols. While it is optimised for wireless mesh networks, Babel will also work efficiently on wired networks. It will generate between 1.2 and 2.4 times the amount of routing traffic that RIPng would generate, while never counting to infinity.

It is lightweight and efficient and therefore appropriate for small embedded routers. This is IPv4 version of BIRD, it supports OSPFv2, RIPv2 and BGP protocols. In BGP, BIRD supports communities, multiprotocol extensions, MD5 authentication, 32bit AS numbers and could act as a route server or a route reflector. BIRD also supports multiple RIBs, multiple kernel routing tables and redistribution between the protocols with a powerful configuration syntax.

In order to be implemented, new technology needs supporting hardware and software across a set of devices and systems. MRD6 is an implementation of a modular IPv6 Multicast Routing Framework for the Linux operating system and provides MLDv2 (as well as MLDv1), PIM-SM and MBGP support.

Description: ndppd, or NDP Proxy Daemon, is a daemon that proxies NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) messages between interfaces. ndppd currently only supports Neighbor Solicitation Messages and Neighbor Advertisement Messages. The ndp_proxy provided by Linux doesn't support listing proxies, and only hosts are supported. No subnets. ndppd solves this by listening for Neighbor Solicitation messages on an interface, then query the internal interfaces for that target IP before finally sending a Neighbor Advertisement message.
